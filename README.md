Repository: https://github.com/mbussert/react-employee-directory

## Description:

A simple and easy-to-use employee directory application built with React and Material-UI. Each column of data is sortable (asc & desc), searchable, and can also be filtered and hidden to allow the user to narrow their results. The application makes an API call, parses the response and automatically builds out the table. A user is able to view 25, 50, or 100 employees per page.
